To use this demo of the wavefolder~, wavestretcher~ and wavecutter~ objects:

Use the "Find Externals..." option in the help menu of Pd (0.47 and above) to install the following libraries:

moonlib
ekext
zexy

Then load the file 00-Wavefolder_Demo_Sync.pd

Use the qwerty keyboard to play notes, and click and drag the "select" number on the right of the synth to play different examples.

Enjoy!
