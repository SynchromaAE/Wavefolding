To use this demo of the wavefolder~, wavestretcher~ and wavecutter~ objects:

First install Pure Data from http://puredata.info

Then, use the "Find Externals..." option in the help menu of Pd (0.47 and above) to install the following libraries:

First search for moonlib and install,
Then search for ekext and install,
Then search for zexy and install.

This should work for you in this directory, if you are running a Mac OSX 64 bit version (the latest) or a Linux 64 bit version. If you're running a 32 bit version of either, there are 32bit versions of the externals in the lib32.tar.gz archive that you can copy into this directory (after you have downloaded and unzipped it). Hopefully I will have sorted out the Deken (Find Extenals" entries by the time you read this, but time is a continuum!.

I'll get Windows versions sorted ASAP - not so soon unfotunately, but you can compile the objects with MSYS and CYgwin for yourself if you know how.

Then load the file 00-Wavefolder_Demo_Sync.pd - hit a key on the QWERTY keyboard (e.g. the 'v' key) and if you hear sound, you're probably OK to go.

If not you can email me at synchroma@gmail.com

Use the qwerty keyboard to play notes, and click and drag the "select" number on the right of the synth to play different examples.

Enjoy!
